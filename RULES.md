# User Rules

1. **NO UNSOLICITED CODE CHANGES**: When the user asks a question, **ANSWER THE QUESTION**. Do **NOT** modify code unless explicitly requested to "fix", "change", or "implement" something.
2. **ANSWER FIRST**: Prioritize explaining the solution or situation before jumping into tool execution.
3. **SPECIFIC COMMITS ONLY**: NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` unless strictly necessary for a new project. Always `git add <specific_file>` for updates.
